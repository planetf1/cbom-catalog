Discovering, managing, and reporting on cryptographic assets is necessary as the first step on the migration journey to quantum-safe systems and applications. Cryptography is typically buried deep within components used to compose and build systems and applications. As part of an agile cryptographic approach, organizations should seek to understand what cryptographic assets they are using and facilitate the assessment of the risk posture to provide a starting point for mitigation.</p> <p>Source: https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/cbom/</p>"},{"location":"links/","title":"Links","text":""},{"location":"links/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Useful links</p> Link Description https://owasp.org/blog/2023/10/03/CycloneDX-Cryptography-CBOM"},{"location":"tooling/","title":"Tooling","text":""},{"location":"tooling/#tooling","title":"Tooling","text":"<p>The following tools may be useful in generating cboms</p> Name License URL Language Description cdxgen Apache 2.0 https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen Java, Python SBOM creation tool supporting many languages.
